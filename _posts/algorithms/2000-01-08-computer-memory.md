In order to run code, computers need to keep track of pieces of information like variables.

![computer memory diagram](../assets/img/analysis-design-algorithms/computer-memory.svg)

The three main forms of memory are **cache**, **main memory** and **secondary memory**.



<dl>

<dt>Cache</dt>
<dd>Holds temporary data that is frequently used by the CPU.
    <li>Extremely fast</li>
    <li>Limited capacity and very expensive</li>
</dd>

<dt>Main Memory</dt>
<dd>Holds the current programs, instructions and data.
    <li>A computer's main memory is RAM</li>
    <li>Faster than secondary memory, but slower than cache</li>
    <li>Volatile memory (requires power to retain stored data)</li>
</dd>

<dt>Secondary Memory</dt>
<dd>
    Holds data or information that is permanent.
    <li>Can be a hard drive, disk drive, USB, etc.</li>
    <li>Slower than main memory</li>
    <li>No volatile (does not require power to store memory)</li>
</dd>

</dl>
