The ```LIKE``` operator is used to search for patterns in a ```WHERE``` clause.

Two wildcards can be used with the ```LIKE``` operator:
1. ```%``` The percent sign represents, zero, one or many characters.
2. ```_``` The underscore represents a single character.

For case insensitivity use the ```iLIKE``` operator.

### Syntax

```https
SELECT <columns> FROM <table-name> 
WHERE <column> LIKE <pattern>; 
```
