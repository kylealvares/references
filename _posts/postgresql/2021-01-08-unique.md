The ```UNIQUE``` constraint ensures that an attributes value is unique within its column.
When inserting a row it checks if the value is already in the table. 
It the value exists it rejects the change and issues an error.

### Syntax

```https
CREATE TABLE <table-name> (
    <column-name> <column-type>,
    <column-name> <column-type>,
    ...
);
```

### Example

```https
CREATE TABLE Companies (
    name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    type TEXT UNIQUE,
    founded INT,
    hq TEXT,
    stock_symbol VARCHAR(5) UNIQUE
);
```

<h2 id="pvu-keys">Primary vs. Unique keys</h2>

1. There can be only one ```PRIMARY KEY``` for a relation, but several ```UNIQUE``` attributes.
1. No attribute of a ```PRIMARY KEY``` can ever be ```NULL``` in any tuple.
   1. But attributes declared ```UNIQUE``` may have NULLâ€™s, and there may be several tuples with ```NULL```.
