The `GROUP BY` clause groups data with same values as specified.
The `SUM` and `COUNT` aggregate functions are typically used to get the size of a group.

### Syntax

```https
SELECT <column> FROM <table> GROUP BY <column>;
```
with aggregate function:
```https
SELECT <column>, <aggregate-function> 
FROM <table> 
GROUP BY <column>;
```

### Example #1

```https
SELECT hq, COUNT(*) FROM Companies GROUP BY hq;
```

<table>
    <caption>Result from Example #1</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>HQ</th>
            <th>Count</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>United States</td>
            <td>3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Canada</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Group By Having

The `HAVING` clause acts as a filter for the `GROUP BY` clause.

### Syntax

```https
SELECT <column>, <aggregate-function> 
FROM <table> 
GROUP BY <column>
HAVING <condition>;
```

### Example #2

```https
SELECT hq, COUNT(*) 
FROM Companies 
GROUP BY hq
HAVING COUNT(*) > 0
ORDER BY hq;
```

<table>
    <caption>Result from Example #2</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>HQ</th>
            <th>Count</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Canada</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>United States</td>
            <td>3</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
