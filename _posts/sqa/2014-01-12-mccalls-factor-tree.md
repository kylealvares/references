McCall's factor model **classifies all software requirements** into 11 factors that can be grouped in 3 categories:

- [Product Operation Factors](#product-operation-factors)
- [Product Revision Factors](#product-revision-factors)
- [Product Transition Factors](#product-transition-factors)

## Product Operation Factors
Factors that deal with requirements that directly affect the daily operation of the software.

<dl>
<dt>Correctness</dt>
<dd>The degree to which software meets its requirements.</dd>
<dt>Reliability</dt>
<dd>The degree to which software runs correctly without error.</dd>
<dt>Efficiency</dt>
<dd>The degree to which software uses time and resources.</dd>
<dt>Integrity</dt>
<dd>The degree to which software is governed.</dd>
<dt>Usability</dt>
<dd>The time and effort it takes others to learn, understand and operate the software.</dd>
</dl>

## Product Revision Factors
Factors that deal with requirements that affect software maintenance.

<dl>
<dt>Maintainability</dt>
<dd>The time and effort it takes to detect and resolve errors in the software.</dd>
<dt>Flexibility</dt>
<dd>The time and effort needed to improve the software.</dd>
<dt>Testability</dt>
<dd>The time and effort required to ensure the software meets its specified requirements.</dd>
</dl>

## Product Transition Factors
Factors that deal with requirements that affect the adaptation of software to other
platforms, environments, interaction with other software.

<dl>
<dt>Portability</dt>
<dd>The degree to which the software can be transferred to other platforms.</dd>
<dt>Reusability</dt>
<dd>The degree to which a software's code can be reused in other applications.</dd>
<dt>Interoperability</dt>
<dd>The time and effort it takes to integrate two systems together.</dd>
</dl>
