Quality in products and software does not happen by chance.
To achieve quality, we must plan for it from the start and continuously monitor it on a daily basis.
Discipline is required.

There are three **general principles** for quality assurance:

- [Know What You are Doing](#know-what-you-are-doing)
- [Know What You Should be Doing](#know-what-you-should-be-doing)
- [Know How to Measure the Difference](#know-how-to-measure-the-difference)

## Know What You are Doing
You should continuously understand:
* what you are building
* how you are building it
* what you are building currently does

This necessitates organization, such as a *management structure, reporting policies, regular meetings and reviews, and frequent test runs, among other things*. We usually deal with this by following a software process that includes regular *milestones, planning, scheduling, reporting,* and *tracking procedures*.

## Know What You Should be Doing

Here are some ways to determine what you should be doing:
* Have **explicit requirements** and **specifications**
  * Use case analysis
  * Explicit acceptance tests
  * Explicit prototypes
  * Frequent user feedback
* Continuously **track** and **update** the development or evolution cycle

## Know How to Measure the Difference

In the context of software quality, this includes having explicit measures that compare **what we do** to **what we should do**. 

This can be achieved through *complementary* methods:

* **Formal methods** consist of using mathematical models or methods to verify mathematically specified properties.
* **Testing** consists of creating explicit inputs or environments to exercise the software, to measuring it's success.
* **Inspection** consists of regular human reviews of requirements, design, architecture, schedules, and code review.
* **Metrics** are used to measure a known set of simple properties related to quality by instrumenting code or execution.

Testing, inspection and metrics account for the majority of software quality assurance.
