* In Florida, during the trial, it was theorized that Dr. Coppolinoexploited his access to many potent drugs, including once called succinylcholine chloride (an injectable, paralytic agent)
    * A novel technique for the detection of this chemical was used to detect it in Carmela’s brain
* This, and other evidence, was used to convict Dr. Carl of second

## The Innocence Project

* The innocence project is an organization “dedicated to 
exonerating wrongfully convicted people through DNA 
testing and reforming the criminal justice system to 
prevent future injustice.”
* Since 1989, more than 250 people in 34 states have been 
exonerated through post-conviction DNA testing

## Wrongful Convictions

Reasons for wrongful convictions:

* Eyewitness misidentification
* Unreliable or improper forensic science
* False confessions
* Government misconduct
* Informants
* Bad lawyering

## Osgoode Innocence Project

* Established in 1997 to deal with wrongful conviction within 
a Canadian context
* Does not restrict cases to ones involving post-conviction 
DNA evidence


## Forensic Scientists

Forensic scientists help ensure that the **guilty receive punishment** and the **innocent remain free**.

* Practice good science
* Remain impartial
* Educate
* Balance reason and emotion

## The Expert Witness

* Trial courts have **broad discretion** in accepting an individual 
as an **expert witness** on any particular subject
* Must convince a judge that you have expertise in a subject; **either a skill or knowledge**
* The court will usually consider
  * Knowledge acquired through experience
  * Training
  * Education

## Establishing Competency

* Critical to the qualification of a witness as an expert is establishing their **ability** and **competency**
* This typically achieved when an expert witness is asked a **series of questions before the court**
* Competency may established via:
  * Number of years on the job
  * Citing educatorial degrees
  * Participation in training
  * Member of professional society
  * Books / articles published

## Training as an Expert Witness

* Can train with an **experienced expert**
* Independent study
* **Formal education** in the physical sciences provides a firm foundation for learning and understanding the principles of forensic science
* Most importantly - the courts rely on **training** and **years of experience** as a measurement of the knowledge and ability of the expert


## The Process in Court

Even if you are deemed to be competent, the significance placed on the expert’s testimony may greatly depends on:
* Experience
* Demeanor (were they clear, concise, and logical in their testimony)
* Most courts are reluctant to disqualify an individual as an expert even if they have little experience

## Expert Testimony vs Lay Witness Testimony

* An ordinary witness must testify on **events or observations** that arise from personal knowledge
  * Must be **factual**
  * Cannot contain **personal opinions**
* An expert witness is explicitly brought in to evaluate evidence when the court lacks the expertise to do so
  * They express their **opinion** as to the significance of the findings
  * The views expressed are represented solely as the expert's opinion, and **may then be accepted or ignored** during jury deliberations

## The Nature of the Expert Testimony

* The expert **cannot** render a view with **absolute certainty**
* Can only **offer an opinion** based on **reasonable scientific certainty** derived from training and expertise
* As an expert, you are expected to defend vigorously the techniques and conclusions of the analysis
  * Should not be an **advocate of one party's cause**
  * Are merely weight in on the **science**
* It is the duty of the **judge or jury** to weigh the pros and cons of all the information presented when deciding guilt or innocence
