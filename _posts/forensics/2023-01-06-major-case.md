## The LOSER Principle

Listen, Observe, Search, Evaluate, Record

<dl>
<dt>Listen</dt>
<dd>
Depending on the part you play in the investigation, will 
determine who you have to listen to, so lets review the 
roles of the players and possible contributors of that 
information: ???
</dd>
<dt>Observe</dt>
<dd>
Even before you get to the scene you should be attentive 
to surroundings, especially vehicles and people in the 
general area, so lets once again discuss what we see and 
how it is interpreted: ???
</dd>
<dt>Search</dt>
<dd>
Before we search lets secure the area if it has not already 
been done, so what do we use: ???
Depending on the size of the area to be searched will 
dictate the type of procedure we utilise so lets talk about 
standard practices and obviously the amount of personnel 
available to assist:??? 
</dd>
<dt>Evaluate</dt>
<dd>What information have we gathered since notified of the 
incident, what has changed, what has happened, what do 
we hope the outcome will be so once again lets review 
what we have but remember we have only one chance to 
get it right, so do it right the first time: ???</dd>
<dt>Record</dt>
<dd>
<li>I have a good memory, so why do I have to record what I 
am doing and what method do you want me to use ?</li>
<li>Lets consider it may be three to four years before this case 
gets to court and if you think that it will be the only one 
you are involved with, good luck.</li>
<li>How do we keep track of any evidence that is seized or 
developed and who is responsible for it’s security ?</li>
</dd>

## What is a 'Major Case'?

The following criteria offences are deemed to be major cases:

* **Homicides** as defined in subsection 222(4), Criminal Code of Canada, and attempts
* **Sexual assaults**, and all attempts (includes sexual interference, exploitation and touching)
* Occurrences involving non-familial **abductions** & attempts
* **Missing person** occurrences, where circumstances indicate a strong possibility of foul play
* Occurrences suspected to be homicide involving found **human remains**
* **Criminal harassment** cases in which the offender is not known to the victim
* Any other case designated as a major case by the Major Case Management Executive Board

## Major Case Identification System

The process of early detection & linkages.

Achieved through:
* Violent Crime Linkage Analysis Software (ViCLAS)
* Centre of Forensic Sciences (CFS)
* DNA Data Bank
* Office of the Chief Coroner
* Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC)
* Major Case Management Software –PowerCase
* Serial Predatory Crime Investigator
* Ontario Sex Offender Registry

### ViCLAS

Automated case linkage system designed to capture, collate 
and compare crimes of violence through the analysis of 
victimology, offender/suspect description, modus operandi, 
forensic and behavioral data

### Forensic Services & Coroner’s Complex

<dl>
<dt>Centre of Forensic Sciences</dt>
<dd>Provide scientific laboratory services in support of the administration of justice and public safety</dd>
<dt>Office of the Chief Coroner</dt>
<dd>Central repository of all death reports that have been 
investigated by all Coroners throughout the Province of 
Ontario</dd>
</dl>

### DNA Data Bank

National repository for DNA profiles of unknown DNA samples from crime scenes and profiles of offenders convicted of designated offences (*Results as of 31 January 2017*).
*  Receives ~500-600 samples per week. Proclaimed *30 Jun 2000*
*  Offender hits; Crime Scene to Offender; 43,563
*  Forensic hits; Crime Scene to Crime Scene; 4969

### Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC)

National repository of data on charged, wanted, missing 
persons, stolen vehicles, property and other crime-related 
data

### Power Case

Ministry approved - Major Case Management Software

* Centralized and secure data storage 
* Evidence management
* Research
* Assign and track lines of investigation
* Intelligence analysis
* Court preparation

### Serial Predatory Crime Investigator (SPCI)

Responsible for the review, development and coordination 
of multi-jurisdictional and single jurisdiction investigations 
of linked major cases

> When “a reasonable likelihood” exists that the same person(s) has committed the crimes. When that criterion is met, the SPCI co-ordinator is notified and becomes part of the probe.

Daren Millard is a prime example of this area of 
responsibility

### Ontario Sex Offender Registry

Provincial legislation which requires convicted offenders to, 
on court order, report and supply local police services with 
their current address and notify police of any address 
change

<dl>
<dt>Christopher’s Law</dt>
<dd>April 23, 2001 –Ontario first and only to establish registry</dd>
</dl>

**Bill 163** (2013), amended legislation, adding: 
* Reporting obligations - to enable the province to require offenders to report within seven days instead of the current 15 
* The addition of offenders convicted outside of Canada, and 
* The addition of offenders pardoned under the Criminal Records Act 

### Inter-disciplinary Approach

* Forensic Identification Officers 
* Forensic pathology
* Forensic odontology / dentistry
* Forensic anthropology / archaeology
* Forensic Entomology
* Pattern / wound interpretation
* Other medical experts
* Other forensic experts
    * CFS
    * Climatology, Knot analysis


## Death Investigation Case

Public service functions
* Identifying epidemics of infectious disease
* Inheritance recipient
* Forensic aspect is determining cause/manner of death:
    * **Cause of death** is the disease / injury responsible for the lethal sequence of events
    * **Manner of death** explains how the cause of death arose
    * **Mechanism of death** is the process (physiological / biochemical) leading to death

### Pronouncing Death

* Pre-stethoscopes
    * Tongue and nipple pulling
    * Tobacco smoke enemas
    * Insertion of hot pokers into various bodily orifices
* 17<sup>th</sup> century
  * Waiting mortuaries
* Stethoscope (1816)
    * Presence/absence of a heartbeat
    * EKG
    * CPR (20th century)

### Time of Death

The time of method is only an estimate, and used in conjunction with other methods.

<!-- empty character used to better space table -->

| Stages of Death | Postmortem Changes | Time Since Death |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rigor mortis | Stiffening | 4hrs; 24-36hrs |
| Livor mortisㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ | Settling ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ| Minutes; 36hrs (fixed at 12hrs) ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ |
| Algor mortis | Cooling | Variable |

### Team Players
* Medical Examiner ( A term used in USA only)
* Coroner
* Forensic Pathologists

### Canadian Coroners

There are **two systems**. 

* Jurisdiction of Provincial/Territorial government
  * **Coroner** =  **Medical Examiner** (depends where)
  * **Coroners are not necessarily physicians** (B.C. Sask. Que. N.B. Nw.T. Nun. Yuk.)

Do not determine civil or criminal responsibility, rather 
that make and offer recommendations. Why?
* Improve public safety
* Prevention of similar future deaths

### Ontario Coroners 

* Coroners in Ontario are medical doctors with specialized 
training in death investigation
* Available to the community 24 hrs a day / 7 days a week
* Coroners report to the Chief Coroner who is responsible 
for all coroners in Ontario
* Coroners investigate deaths that happen under certain 
circumstances as determined by a provincial law called the 
Coroners Act of Ontario
Currently have dual leadership
  * Office of the Chief Coroner & Ontario Forensic Pathology Service

### Coroner vs Pathologist

### Ontario Forensic Pathology Service

* Dr. Michael Pollanen, Chief Forensic Pathologist
* ~6000 autopsies/year (coroner-ordered)
* Kingston, London, Ottawa, Sault Ste. Marie, Sudbury and Toronto

### The Investigation

* Certification
  * Identify
  * Cause & Manner of Death
    * Manner of Death: natural, accident, suicide, homicide, undetermined
    * Cause of death: "results in", temporal delay not relevant
* Investigation
  * Collection of Samples
  * Timing, mechanism, contributing factors
  * Correlation of evidence

### Autopsy

Postmortem examination - a process whereby a 
pathologist or forensic pathologist examines the 
decedent’s body to help determine cause of death. 

* Internal & External examination
    * Incision
    * Removal of skull cap
    * Major organs are examined & sampled
