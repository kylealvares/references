**Forensic science** also known as criminalistics is the application of science in criminal and civil laws. It is the intersection of law and science.

The science used in legal investigations includes but is not limited to: chemistry, *biology, physics, computer science, medicine, pharmacology, anthropology, archaeology, marine science and psychology*.

The media have increased the public's awareness of the use of science in criminal investigations. It has created unrealistic expectations such as:
* the amount of time a procedure takes
* **every** crime scene yields forensic evidence that supports a case (*myth*)

The **CSI Effect** is the unrealistic and detrimental expectations that a prosecutor's case should be bolstered by forensic evidence. This has led to juries placing lots of weight on forensic evidence.

## History of Forensic Science

| Year | Event |
| --- | --- |
| Pre-700 B.C. | Fingerprints ar used fon clay tablets for business transactions in ancient Babylon |
| 287 - 212 B.C. | Archimedes proves impurity of golden crown using density and buoyancy |
| 1235 - 1248 A.D. | Sung Tz’u’s “The Washing Away of Wrongs” is released. The first recorded application of medicine to help solve crimes |
| 1447 A.D. | Charles the Bold's missing teeth were used to identify his remains |
| 1590 A.D. | The first optical microscope is developed |

## Key People

The **mid 19<sup>th</sup> century** is when forensic science began to coalesce as a recognized principle. The key people included:

| Person | Years | Ethnicity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Victor Balthazard](#victor-balthazard) | 1852 - 1950 | French |
| [Alphonse Bertillion](#alphonse-bertillon) | 1853 - 1914 | French |
| [Sir Francis Galton](#sir-francis-galton) | 1822 - 1911 | English |
| Calvin Goddard | 1891 - 1955 | American |
| Hans Gross | 1847 - 1915 | Austrian |
| [Edmond Locard](#edmond-locard) | 1877 - 1966 | French |
| Mathieu Orfila | 1787 - 1853 | Spanish / French |

### Victor Balthazard

* Medical examiner in Paris
* Helped advance fingerprint, firearm and hair analysis
* Probability models for fingerprints (1 / 10<sup>60</sup> chance for shared fingerprint)
* Photographic method for comparing bullet markings
  * Firing pin and fabric impressions of a soft lead bullet moving through fabrics
* Wrote the first comprhensive book on hair analysis entitles - *The Hair of Man and Animals* (1910)

### Alphonse Bertillon

* Developed the first systematic method fo rthe identification and suspects of criminals
* Called **Anthropometry** or **Bertillonage**
  * Based on 11 body measurements
  * Descriptive information
  * Photographs
  * Fingerprints (not commonly collected)
* Commonly used from 1883 to early 1900s
* Despite initial resistance to fingerprint use, Bertillion was the first person to use them to solve a crime

### Sir Francis Galton

* Fist classification system for fingerprints
  * Basic patterns: *Loop, Arch* and *Whorl*
* Published *Finger Prints* (1892) which brought fingerprinting to the forefront of criminal identification
  * Still considered primary reference in the field

### Edmond Locard

* Trained both law and medicine
* Established a Forensic laboratory in Lyon, France
* Interested in microscopic and trace evidence
  * Believed that it was crucial in linking people to places
* Most famous for **Locard's Exchange Principle**
  * Usually paraphrased as *'every contact leaves a trace'*


## Science and the Law Today

### Law: A Way to Settle Disputes

The law is a way disputes can be settled:
* **Criminal Law**: between individuals and the state
* **Civil Law**: among individuals or entities

Guided by the law, precedent and functions using and **adversarial system**:
* Two opposing sides arguing for acceptance
 * **The finder or trier of fact** usually a judge or jury determines the truth based on evidence presented by two opposing sides (**outcome based**)

### Science: A Way to Study the Natural World

Science enables us to ask basic questions (ex. *what was the cause of death*) and helps us answer these questions using observation, testing and interpretation through logic (**scientific method**).

#### Scientific Definitions

<dl>
<dt>Hypothesis</dt>
<dd><strong>A testable idea</strong>, not simply an educated guess; the tenative explanation for an observation, phenomenon, or scientific problem that can be tested by further investigation</dd>
<dt>Scientific theory</dt>
<dd><strong>Explanation</strong> (not guess) of some aspect of the natural world that has been substantiated through repeated experiments or testing. Can be <em><strong>supported</strong>, <strong>rejected</strong>, or <strong>modified based on new evidence</strong></em></dd>
<dt>Fact</dt>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>A confirmed or agreed-upon empirical observation or conclusion</li>
<li>Knowledge or information based on real occurrences</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>

The core logic of science is to **test ideas with evidence**.
The **scientific method** offers a framework for how to conduct research. Science is **iterative** (*not linear and not predetermined*) and circles back so that useful ideas are built upon; the framework includes:
* Asking questions
* Making observations
* Formulating hypotheses
* Performing experiments
* Collecting data
* Drawing conclusions

Science is **collaborative** and depends on interactions within the scientific community. Different parts of the process may be carried out be different people at different times. 

Science relies on **creativity** as it is exciting, dynamic and unpredictable. Science relies on creative people thinking outside the box. Good problem soliving and solid methodology is important for both "hard" and "soft" sciences. 

Science of **never over**, and scientific conclusions are always revisable if warranted by the evidence.
* Science is falsifiable
* Something cannot be scientific if it does not admit the possibility 
of being shown false

Most scientists would not say that science leads to an understanding of the “truth”.
* Science is a determination of what is most likely to be correct at 
the current time with the available evidence

#### The Role of the Forensic Scientist

A forensic scientist is not concerned with the truth. A forensic scientist only cares about the evidence:
* Proper evidence collection
* Identifying the evidence
* Contamination issues
* Proper documentation
* Clear communication of ideas


### Modern Practice of Forensic Science

* Training includes a variety of forms; CSI (police officers, general patrol...) and for Forensic Scientists (scientists / technicians, undergraduate education...)
* Public laboratories - funded by the government
* Private laboratories - designed to make a profit
* Forensic scientists can use science from several areas including *biology, chemistry, toxicology, documents, firearms, toolmarks* and *electronics*
* Academic professors *teach forensic science, create mock crime scenes, curriculum development, and research*


### Types of Legal Proceedings

#### Legal Proceedings
<dl>
<dt>Criminal Cases - Government and Individual</dt>
<dd>
<li>Violation of criminal laws (felony / misdemeanor)</li>
<li>Guilty beyond a reasonable doubt (99%)</li>
</dd>
<dt>Civil Cases - Individuals</dt>
<dd>
<li>Lawsuit or being sued (ex. patent infringement)</li>
<li>Preponderance of evidence (51%)</li>
</dd>
<dt>Jurisdictions</dt>
<dd>
<li>Different legal rules and procedures (local, state, federal, etc.)</li>
</dd>
</dl>

#### Legal Proceedings: Roles

* Trier / Finder-of-fact
* Prosecution / Plaintiff
  * **Prosecution:** Bears the burden of proving a defendant guilty beyond reasonable doubt
  * **Plaintiff:** Prove case by preponderance of the evidence
* Defendant
* Forensic scientists can testify on either side

#### Forensic Scientist's Day in Court
* Analysis → Report → Subpoena
* Voir Dire
  * Background, training, experience
* Direct Examination
  * Lay foundation for the admissibility of the evidence in question
* Cross Examination
  * Discredit witness or evidence
* Re-direct / Re-cross


### Ethics and Forensic Science
* No one code of ethics 
  * Ex. The American Academy of Forensic Sciences 
* In general:
  * Do the best work you can do on every case that is submitted
  * Provide a complete and honest report of your work
  * Testify with their scientific opinion based on the report and their knowledge in the field
* It is possible to have situations where different experts may draw different conclusions from the same evidence
  * Difference of opinion ≠ Unethical
  * Present and defend; the trier of fact makes the ultimate decision


Evidence refers to information or objects that may be admitted into court for judges and juries to consider when hearing a case. 

## Rules of Evidence

Information that is court approved (*good science, relevant, correctly collected, thoroughly documented*) that is used to determine guilt or innocence is evidence. The rules of evidence are used to determine whether something is admissible or inadmissible. This serves to screen out or exclude irrelevant or prohibited evidence.

The rules of evidence are applied to determine the **admissibility of all information**, such as:
* Eyewitness testimony
* Photographs
* Physical objects
* Scientifically generated information like DNA

If the information survives, it can be accepted as evidence of a material fact in the ensuing trial. Ultimately, forensic (and other types) of evidence are used to reconstruct the events of a crime.

## Admissibility 

A key pre-requisite of admissibility for any piece of information is *a solid supportive foundation for any offer of evidence*. There must be **enough information** to convince a judge that the proposed time of evidence **may in fact be true**.

**Admissible evidence** must be:
* Reliable
* Relevant to the case at hand
* Scientifically acceptable


### Admissibility Hearings

**Admissibility hearings** provide a way for *new* scientific methods to be **introduced and accepted as viable tools in forensic science**. The can be held during the presentation of the case or separately.

The standards used by courts can vary by jurisdiction, these are some important ones:
- The Frye Decision and Frye Standard
- The Federal Rules of Evidence
- Daubert Decision (1993)
- The Trilogy

### The Frye Decision and Frye Standard

In 1920, Mr. James Frye was charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of a physician named Dr. Robert W. Brown. The defense attempted to get an expert to testify that  Mr. Fyre had taken, and passed, a **lie detector test**. 

The judge disallowed the testimony:
* Rejected the scientific validity of the lie detector test due to the *novel* nature of the newly developed technology
* Fyre was convicted

He appealed but the decision was upheld and the **Fyre Standard** was developed. The Fyre Standard established the criteria known as **general acceptance**. To meet the Fyre Standard the court must decide whether the questioned **procedure**, **technique**, or **principle** is "generally accepted" by a **meaningful segment of the relevant scientific community**.

Whe a test **has not gained scientific recognition** from psychological and physiological authorities, expert testimony regarding the results of such a test is inadmissible.

### The Federal Rules of Evidence

Rule 702 was a minor step forward from the Fyre Standard. "Testimony by Experts" stated:  If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.

> The evolution from generalists to specialists, makes the 'general acceptance' more difficult to obtain. Rule 702 made it a little easier.

However Rule 702 did not specify how a witness was qualified or what, specifically, the court should weigh when making that assessment.

### Daubert Decision (1993)

Daubert vs Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals
* Jason Daubert and Eric Shuller were born with serious birth defects
* They, and their parents, believed that a morning sickness medication, Bendectin, was responsible
* Both sides submitted scientific evidence which reached different conclusions

The Supreme Court ruled that **general acceptance is not an absolute requirement for determining admissibility**. The decision also established the role of a trial judge as **the gatekeeper**.

Daubert and Shuller's expert testimony was *disallowed for not using acceptable scientific methods*. The Supreme Court also offered suggestions for making the determination, while leaving some flexibility to the judge. The five factors the court may consider are:

* Has the technique been tested in actual field conditions?
* Has the technique been subject to peer review and publication?
* What is the known or potential rate of error?
* Do standards exist for the control of the technique's operation?
* Has the technique been generally accepted within the relevant scientific community?

### The Trilogy

The trilogy are three decisions which significantly impacted the way 
evidence admissibility is addressed.

1. Daubert
 * Established the judge as the gatekeeper
1. Joiner (*General Electric Company vs. Joiner*) 
   * Employee claimed that the chemicals he was exposed to at work gave him cancer and wanted to have animal studies submitted to support his case
   * The cour rejected these studies because they focused on:
      * Different chemicals
      * Different exposure levels
   * Evidence must pass **Daubert criteria** and **relevance test**
1. Kumho (**Kumho Tire Company vs. Carmichael**)
   * Civil case centered on the responsibility of the tire company in a fatality that resulted from an accident attributed to tire failure
   * One expert witness was an engineer, and the court ruled that the testimony offered by the engineer fell under the umbrella of scientific expert
   * Kumho extended the Daubert ruling to **all experts** (not just scientists)


## Categories of Evidence

<dl>
<h3>Inclusive vs. Exclusive</h3>
<dt>Inclusive evidence</dt>
<dd>the evidence is included in the 
population of items that could have been the 
source of the evidence in question </dd>
<dt>Exclusive evidence</dt>
<dd>the evidence is excluded from 
the population of items that could have been the 
source of the evidence in question</dd>

<h3>Direct vs. Circumstantial</h3>
<dt>Direct evidence</dt>
<dd>Is that which is known to a person by 
personal knowledge, such as eyewitness testimony.</dd>
<dt>Circumstantial evidence</dt>
<dd>Is evidence that requires 
inference to move logically from the information provided 
to the answer to a question (evidence must still be tied to the suspect)</dd>

<h3>Reconstruction Evidence</h3>
<dt>Direct evidence</dt>
<dd>Is that which is known to a person by 
personal knowledge, such as eyewitness testimony.</dd>
<dt>Reconstruction evidence</dt>
<dd>Provides information about the events <em>preceding</em>, <em>occurring during</em>, and <em>occurring after</em> commission of a crime
<ul>
<li>Useful if a suspect admits to being present, but denies 
involvement</li>
<li>Involves scientific principles, but also requires 
<strong>logic</strong>,
<strong>observations</strong>,
<strong>experience</strong>, and
<strong>witness statement evaluation</strong>.
</li>
<li><strong>Associative evidence</strong>: associate or dissociate a suspect to a crime</li>
<li><strong>Exemplar</strong>: a sample of known origin used as a reference</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<h3>Class vs. Individual</h3>
<dt>Class Characteristic Evidence</dt>
<dd>Does not reference a particular suspect; it has the ability to narrow a field down to a group</dd>
<dt>Individual Characteristic Evidence</dt>
<dd>Does associate a particular individual with the commission of a crime; it has the ability to pin point a source</dd>

</dl>

The ultimate goal of forensic science is to link a potential 
offender to a crime scene
* Individual evidence is ideal
* Class evidence is still extremely important
* Class evidence is typically examined based on inclusiveness or exclusiveness

The type of evidence is important, but the significance of 
the evidence cannot be understated, The significance depends on a variety of factors:

* Biology
    * Focus on human tissues
    * DNA/Blood grouping
* Chemistry
    * Seized drugs
    * Toxicology samples
    * Explosives
* Trace
    * Locard’sexchange principle
* Fingerprint
    * Latent (invisible) print development
    * Print identification
* Impression
    * Footwear
    * Tire treads
* Firearm and Toolmarks
    * Fired bullets
    * Cartridge casings


## Types of Witnesses

1. Eyewitness
2. Hearsay witness
3. Character witness
4. Expert witness

## Case File: The Coppolino's

People: 
Carl Coppolino,
Carmela Coppolino,
Mary Gibson,
Marjorie Farber,
William Farber

* Based on this, both William Farber and Carmela Coppolino’sbodies were exhumed
* Dr. Carl Coppolino was tried in NJ for the death of William Farber and acquitted based on a lack of evidence for poisoning
* In Florida, during the trial, it was theorized that Dr. Coppolinoexploited his access to many potent drugs, including once called succinylcholine chloride (an injectable, paralytic agent)
    * A novel technique for the detection of this chemical was used to detect it in Carmela’s brain
* This, and other evidence, was used to convict Dr. Carl of second

## The Innocence Project

* The innocence project is an organization “dedicated to 
exonerating wrongfully convicted people through DNA 
testing and reforming the criminal justice system to 
prevent future injustice.”
* Since 1989, more than 250 people in 34 states have been 
exonerated through post-conviction DNA testing

## Wrongful Convictions

Reasons for wrongful convictions:

* Eyewitness misidentification
* Unreliable or improper forensic science
* False confessions
* Government misconduct
* Informants
* Bad lawyering

## Osgoode Innocence Project

* Established in 1997 to deal with wrongful conviction within 
a Canadian context
* Does not restrict cases to ones involving post-conviction 
DNA evidence


## Forensic Scientists

Forensic scientists help ensure that the **guilty receive punishment** and the **innocent remain free**.

* Practice good science
* Remain impartial
* Educate
* Balance reason and emotion

## The Expert Witness

* Trial courts have **broad discretion** in accepting an individual 
as an **expert witness** on any particular subject
* Must convince a judge that you have expertise in a subject; **either a skill or knowledge**
* The court will usually consider
  * Knowledge acquired through experience
  * Training
  * Education

## Establishing Competency

* Critical to the qualification of a witness as an expert is establishing their **ability** and **competency**
* This typically achieved when an expert witness is asked a **series of questions before the court**
* Competency may established via:
  * Number of years on the job
  * Citing educatorial degrees
  * Participation in training
  * Member of professional society
  * Books / articles published

## Training as an Expert Witness

* Can train with an **experienced expert**
* Independent study
* **Formal education** in the physical sciences provides a firm foundation for learning and understanding the principles of forensic science
* Most importantly - the courts rely on **training** and **years of experience** as a measurement of the knowledge and ability of the expert


## The Process in Court

Even if you are deemed to be competent, the significance placed on the expert’s testimony may greatly depends on:
* Experience
* Demeanor (were they clear, concise, and logical in their testimony)
* Most courts are reluctant to disqualify an individual as an expert even if they have little experience

## Expert Testimony vs Lay Witness Testimony

* An ordinary witness must testify on **events or observations** that arise from personal knowledge
  * Must be **factual**
  * Cannot contain **personal opinions**
* An expert witness is explicitly brought in to evaluate evidence when the court lacks the expertise to do so
  * They express their **opinion** as to the significance of the findings
  * The views expressed are represented solely as the expert's opinion, and **may then be accepted or ignored** during jury deliberations

## The Nature of the Expert Testimony

* The expert **cannot** render a view with **absolute certainty**
* Can only **offer an opinion** based on **reasonable scientific certainty** derived from training and expertise
* As an expert, you are expected to defend vigorously the techniques and conclusions of the analysis
  * Should not be an **advocate of one party's cause**
  * Are merely weight in on the **science**
* It is the duty of the **judge or jury** to weigh the pros and cons of all the information presented when deciding guilt or innocence

## Defining a Crime Scene

"**Any place** where a crime scene has been committed."

Many different ways to classify a crime scene:
1. Location of original criminal activity
   * **Primary scene**: site of the original criminal activity
   * **Secondary crime scenes**: any subsequent locations
   * This classification scheme **has nothing to to do** with a scene's relative importance (**simply a sequence of locations**)
2. Size of the crime scene
   * **Macroscopic** refers to the **overall** crime scene
   * **Microscopic** refers to the **trace evidence** (smaller scenes within the larger)
3. Other
   * No single definition works for all crime scenes
   * The crime scene **expands and changes** as the evidence dictates the:
     * Type of crime committed
     * Crime scene condition
     * Physical location of the crime
     * Type of criminal behaviour associated with the scene

## The Importance of Physical Evidence

Three major avenues availble to investigators to solve crimes and are very helpful with reconstructing a crime scene which are:
* Confessions
* Eyewitness accounts 
* Physical evidence (only physical evidence is free of inherent error or bias)

Physical evidence can:

* Prove a crime was committed
* Link a system with a victim or with a crime scene
* Establish identity of persons associated with the crime scene
* Corroborate or refute testimony
* Be more reliable than testimony
* Provide investigative leads
* Identify unknown substances


Physical evidence often lacks individual characteristics that can tie a suspect conclusively to a crime. The likelihood that the suspect and victim are related depends on the number of pieces of evidence linking them and the uniqueness of the evidence. Principles of crime scene investigation are critical, helping: **recognize**, **preserve**, **collect**, and **interpret** physical evidence.

### The Product Rule and Probability

The product rules states that the probability of two independent events occurring together can be calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities of each event occurring alone
  
## General Crime Scene Procedures

### Scene Management

Crime scenes are busy places and **proper management of a scene is critical**. The lead investigator is often the **most experienced** individual and is responsible for managing: 
* Information
* Personnel
* Technology
* Logistics

Several different **management models** are available based on the allocation of personnel, resources, training, expertise, etc. Maintaining **good communication** among all personnel is critical to a successful resolution to the investigation

### First Responding Officer

The first responder is the **first person** at the scene of a crime. They are the only people to view a crime scene in its **most original and pristine condition**. Their **actions** ar the scene can have **far reaching** consequences. They should always keep in mind that they are the **first step** in linking a victim to a suspect. The first responder has several important duties.

#### The Duties of a First Responder

1. Assist the victime and prevent any changes to the victim
2. Search for and arrest the suspect if they are still there
3. Detain any witnesses
    * Keep them seperated to maintain objectivity
    * Do not let them go back to the crime scene
4. Protect and secure the crime scene:
   * Establish a perimeter
   * Prevent contamination
   * Limit access to the scene
5. Document all movements, alterations, or changes made to the crime scene and pass the information along

### Crime Scene Survey

The **preliminary scene survey** is the first examination or orientation of the crime scene by the crime scene investigator. The following guidelines should be followed:
* Use the walk-through as a mental **beginning** for a reconstruction theory - be prepared to change your mind
* Note any evidence that needs **immediate protection or processing**
* Be aware of impending weather conditions that could affect a scene
* Note possible points of entry or exit
* Briefly record initial thoughts on who, what, where, when, and how
* Assess the scene to determine what kind of **personnel**, **equipment**, etc. will be required
* Notify superior officers as needed
* **Transient vs condition** FOLLOW UP!!!

## Crime Scene Documentation and Forensic Photography

The single most important task of the crime scene investigator is generating a permanent record of **the scene and its physical evidence** as it was before processing. This is the most **time-consuming** activity at the scene and requires a **systematic and organized** approach. It may not be evident what is truly important, so **everything must be documented**. 

### Four Major Documentation Tasks

1. Notetaking
   * Effective notes serve as an important written record
   * General guideline for taking notes is to consider who, what when, where and why
   * | Good Note Factors | Information Collected |
     | --- | --- | 
     | Notification Information | Date, Time, Method of notification |
     | Arrival Information | Date, Time, Hwo, Means of transportation |
     | Scene Description | Weather, Location, Condition, Major structures, Transient or conditional evidence? |
     | Victim Description | Position, Wounds, Clothing, Jewelery, Only move a body with the permission of a medical examiner |
     | Crime Scene Team | Who is assigned where, Start / end time|
2. Videography
   * Has now become a routine procedure
   * Can provide virtual image of the scene
   * The form of documentation 
     * **Should** be performed **after** the crime scene survey
     * **Should not** include any members of the investigation team or their equipment
     * **Should not** be narrated or include an audio recording of subjective information at the scene
     * Can provide a valuable tool for overall, accurate impression of the crime scene, but is no substitute for any other tasks
3. Photography
   * Photography provides a **true and accurate** pictoral record of the **crime scene** and the **physical evidence** present
   * Normally performed **immediately after** videography or after preliminary scene search
   * The number of photographs vary from scene to scene
     * Too many is better than too few
   * **Every crime scene photograph** must be recorded in a **photo log** 
     * Includes the time taken, camera settings used, distance to object, type of photograph taken, brief description of image  
4. Sketching
   * The final documentation task
   * Must obtain and record **accurate measurements** of the scene
   * All previous tasks do not have any information about the **objects actual size* or **measurement of scene and its physical evidence**
   * Provides **proper perspective** of the scene and how the physical evidence **relates to the scene**
   * Two main types:
     * Rough sketch
     * Final sketch

### Crime Scene Searches

The **preliminary crime scene search** is simply for orientation purposes and preservation of transient evidence. After **careful documentation** is complete (but before evidence collection starts) a more thorough search for previously overlooked items is performed. **Crime scene search patterns** vary in style but share the same goal of giving a search organization and structure.

There different types of searches and ultimately, the specific search pattern used is unimportant as along as the method is methodical and systematic.

#### Search Methods

Several typical examples of crime-scene search patterns. The pattern selected normally depends on the size and locale of the scene and the number of collectors participating in the search.

1. Spiral 
    * Begin in the middle of an area and follow a clockwise pattern outward
    * Advantages: very effective for small interior scene searches
    * Disadvantages: potential to miss evidence increases and the perimeter increases
2. Strip 
   * A group of investigators begin at one end of the search area and they walk down that strip, at arm’s length in a linear fashion
   * Advantages: Used for large outdoor crime scene
   * Disadvantages: Area search only once, so evidence can be missed
3. Grid
    * Searchers begin at one end of the search area and proceed in a line to the end of the search area. Once completed, searchers cover the same area from a 90° angle
    * Advantages: a second pair of eyes is searching
    * Disadvantages: takes longer than other methods
4. Zone
   * The search area is broken down into zones and each zone is searched individually
   * Advantages: useful in small confined areas
   * Disadvantages: may vary depending on individual search methods used within each zone
5. Ray
   * Searchers start at common/central point and walk away from each other
   * Advantages: good for very large outdoor areas
   * Disadvantages: not ofen used, ineffective


## Collection and Preservation of Physical Evidence

Collection and preservation of physical evidence is extremely important to an investigation. Evidence must be collected, packaged, marked, sealed, and preserved in a **consistent manner**. Different types of physical evidence will require different packing and collection techniques, Transient, fragile or easily lost evidence is given priority.

To secure **trace evidence** most items are packaged **twice** in a primary and secondary container. The **outer containers** are then completely sealed with tamper resistant tape and marked with information about the item (date and time, when the item was collected, location where the item was found). A **seal** is palced over the opening and initial by the collector.

Some types of evidence (liquids, volatiles, biological evidence) requires special packaging considerations. 

* Airtight, unbreakable containers
* Allowed to air dry before packaging
  
Each item of evidence is packaged separately to avoid cross-contamination and it is the job of the collector to ensure this is done properly.

### The Chain of Custody

* A list of all people who came into possession of an item of evidence
* An unbroken chain of custody must be established to get a piece of evidence presented in a court of law

## Crime Scene Reconstruction

![crime scene reconstruction](../assets/img/forensics/crime-scene-reconstruction.svg)


## The Importance of Fingerprints

Today, the fingerprint is the pillar of modern criminal identification.
With fingerprints, unequivocal identification is possible and they are useful for two major reasons:
1. Fingerprints are **unique to each individual**
2. Fingerprints **do not change during a lifetime**

### What are Fingerprints

Fingerprints are the deposition of **friction ridges**. They appear of palms, soles, and the ends of fingers and toes. The ridges provide friction between the grasping mechanism and whatever it grasps. They have certain features:

* **Ridge**: a single curved segment
* **Furrow**: region between two adjacent ridges
* **Pore**: on the ridges 

Fingerprints are produced by:
* The deposition of **sweat**
* by a finger **contaminated with another material**
* by a finger that has been **pushed into a soft material** such as putty

They are the stamp of the ridge detail on the skin's surface. The **age of a fingerprint** is almost impossible to determine. A number of paremeters will determine how well a fingerprint is formed:

* The nature of a surface
* The pressure applied
* The **time** for which pressure is applied

Of all, **contact time** is the most important.


## Types of Fingerprints

### Visible Fingerprints

* Made by fingers touching a surface after the ridges have been in contact with colored colored materials (blood, paint, grease, ink, make-up, etc.)
* **Patent**: meaning obvious or evident; occurs when fingers are contaminated with something
* **Plastic**: made when a finger touches or presses against a soft-pliabe surface
* Plastic prints remain sas long as the impressed material is **structurally intact**
* Prints left ina  medium, such as blood or dust, are **fragile** and **do not last long**

### Latent Fingerprints

* Once the finger touches a surface, **body persperation and/or oils** present on the finger ridges are transferred to that surface, leaving an impression
* Prints deposited in this manner are **invisible to the eye** and are commonly referred to as latent or **invisible** fingerprints
* **Friction ridge examination** is the preeminent method of **individualization** in forensic science
* Latent prints in a proper environment can **last for years**


## Fingerprint Classification

There are several types of whorls – they are the most complex

* **Loop**: a type of fingerprint pattern in which the ridge makes a curving path and then recurves back on itself to form a loop shape.
* **Whorl**: a type of fingerprint pattern in which the ridge makes two complete turns around a central point. Whorls typically have a circular or spiral shape.

In both cases, the patterns are unique to an individual and are used in forensic science for identification purposes.

<p>Loops and whorls contain <strong>cores</strong> and <strong>deltas</strong>.</p>
<p>
<strong>Core</strong>: approximation of the center; location of maximum curvature<br>
<strong>Delta</strong>: point of triangulation; point of divergence
</p>
</div>

</div>

Once general patterns have been linked, it is the **fingerprint minutiae** that are used to **individualize them**. There are on average ~150 ridge characteristics, and about ~8 - 16 matching minutae are sufficient for ID.

Unusal fingerprints can be attributed to **skin diseases** and **genetic diseases** (naegeli syndrome, dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis).

### Illumination Techniques

* Oblique lighting
* Expose fingerprint to UV or laser light
    * Oils and other foreign oils present in perspiration fluoresce when exposed to UV or laser light
  * Usually done after the application of a dye

### Enhancement Techniques

* Enhancement techniques used to **increase contrast** between mark
and background
* Contrast may be in **color or brightness**
* Techniques work by adding a 'label' to **some compounds foud in a fingerprint** (physical and chemical)
* Can use a number of enhancement techniques is succession

### Powder Dusting

* Powders
    * Simplest method
    * Mechanical adherence of powder particles to the sweat components of the friction ridge deposits
    * Color used is determine by background
* Brushes
    * Applied with a soft fiberglass brush that has long, very fine bristles
    * Do not make contact with surface
    * Fiberglass, animal hair (camel, squirrel), synthetic, natural, magnetic

### Chemical Enhancement

* Methods of **visualizing prints** from recovered objects; not conducted at the **crime scene**
* Process involves exposing the object to **fumes**
  * Carried out in a vented container
  * Ex: cyanoacrylate (superglue) fuming

## Fingerprint Comparisons

**ID Fingerprint to Class** (*Loop, Whorl, Arch*) → **ID Fingerprint Minutiae** (*Position, Type, Number, Orientation*)

* **Friction ridges** are studied for the **kind**, **number**, and 
**location** of various ridge characteristics or minutiae 
* Arrangement of characteristics create **one-of-a-kind** pattern 
* A careful **point-by-point study** determines if enough significant 
minutiae present in the known print are present in the questioned 
print

### Friction Ridge Analysis

Forensic scientists debate how many points of comparison are necessary and sufficient to reach a conclusion of identification

* Point counting standard dictated how many points of comparison 
were required before a positive conclusion could be reached (**~8 - 16 points, with no statisstical basis**)
* Most agencies use a "no-point" standard
  * Threshold is one of a **sufficient** number of characteristics necessary to make a conclusion of identification, however many that might be
* **Experience and judgement** are central to the process of quality examination
  * Requires proper training and practical experience
  * Experts must be able to articulate and support their findings
* Majority of prints are identified, resolved and compared are **partial prints**
  * Only a portion of the complete print pattern is represented
  * Scientist must determine if sufficient information is present to  make a proper comparison
* Prints may be **unidentifiable** due to smudging, graininess, or size, it depends upon a scientist's (**experience**, **visual acuity**, and **judgement**)

### Automated Fingerprinting Identification System (AFIS)

AFIS has been around since the 1960's. It as revolutionized law enforcement by computerizing fingerprint search and storage system.

Its applications include:
* Searching for a reference / inked prints
* Searching for single prints

It is an important and useful tool, as it places two images 
side by side and allows the examiner to chart the common 
features on both images simultaneously


## The LOSER Principle

Listen, Observe, Search, Evaluate, Record

<dl>
<dt>Listen</dt>
<dd>
Depending on the part you play in the investigation, will 
determine who you have to listen to, so lets review the 
roles of the players and possible contributors of that 
information: ???
</dd>
<dt>Observe</dt>
<dd>
Even before you get to the scene you should be attentive 
to surroundings, especially vehicles and people in the 
general area, so lets once again discuss what we see and 
how it is interpreted: ???
</dd>
<dt>Search</dt>
<dd>
Before we search lets secure the area if it has not already 
been done, so what do we use: ???
Depending on the size of the area to be searched will 
dictate the type of procedure we utilise so lets talk about 
standard practices and obviously the amount of personnel 
available to assist:??? 
</dd>
<dt>Evaluate</dt>
<dd>What information have we gathered since notified of the 
incident, what has changed, what has happened, what do 
we hope the outcome will be so once again lets review 
what we have but remember we have only one chance to 
get it right, so do it right the first time: ???</dd>
<dt>Record</dt>
<dd>
<li>I have a good memory, so why do I have to record what I 
am doing and what method do you want me to use ?</li>
<li>Lets consider it may be three to four years before this case 
gets to court and if you think that it will be the only one 
you are involved with, good luck.</li>
<li>How do we keep track of any evidence that is seized or 
developed and who is responsible for it’s security ?</li>
</dd>

## What is a 'Major Case'?

The following criteria offences are deemed to be major cases:

* **Homicides** as defined in subsection 222(4), Criminal Code of Canada, and attempts;
* **Sexual assaults**, and all attempts (includes sexual interference, exploitation and touching);
* Occurrences involving non-familial **abductions** & attempts;
* **Missing person** occurrences, where circumstances indicate a strong possibility of foul play;
* Occurrences suspected to be homicide involving found **human remains**;
* **Criminal harassment** cases in which the offender is not known to the victim; and, 
* Any other case designated as a major case by the Major Case Management Executive Board

Daren Millard is a prime example of this area of 
responsibility

### Ontario Sex Offender Registry

Provincial legislation which requires convicted offenders to, 
on court order, report and supply local police services with 
their current address and notify police of any address 
change

<dl>
<dt>Christopher’s Law</dt>
<dd>April 23, 2001 –Ontario first and only to establish registry</dd>
</dl>

**Bill 163** (2013), amended legislation, adding: 
* Reporting obligations - to enable the province to require offenders to report within seven days instead of the current 15 
* The addition of offenders convicted outside of Canada, and 
* The addition of offenders pardoned under the Criminal Records Act 

### Inter-disciplinary Approach

## Death Investigation Case

Public service functions
* Identifying epidemics of infectious disease
* Inheritance recipient
* Forensic aspect is determining cause/manner of death:
    * **Cause of death** is the disease / injury responsible for the lethal sequence of events
    * **Manner of death** explains how the cause of death arose
    * **Mechanism of death** is the process (physiological / biochemical) leading to death

### Pronouncing Death

* Pre-stethoscopes
    * Tongue and nipple pulling
    * Tobacco smoke enemas
    * Insertion of hot pokers into various bodily orifices
* 17<sup>th</sup> century
  * Waiting mortuaries
* Stethoscope (1816)
    * Presence/absence of a heartbeat
    * EKG
    * CPR (20th century)

### Time of Death

The time of method is only an estimate, and used in conjunction with other methods.

<!-- empty character used to better space table -->

| Stages of Death | Postmortem Changes | Time Since Death |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rigor mortis | Stiffening | 4hrs; 24-36hrs |
| Livor mortisㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ | Settling ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ| Minutes; 36hrs (fixed at 12hrs) ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ |
| Algor mortis | Cooling | Variable |

### Team Players
* Medical Examiner ( A term used in USA only)
* Coroner
* Forensic Pathologists

### Canadian Coroners

There are **two systems**. 

* Jurisdiction of Provincial/Territorial government
  * **Coroner** =  **Medical Examiner** (depends where)
  * **Coroners are not necessarily physicians** (B.C. Sask. Que. N.B. Nw.T. Nun. Yuk.)

Do not determine civil or criminal responsibility, rather 
that make and offer recommendations. Why?
* Improve public safety
* Prevention of similar future deaths

### Ontario Coroners 

* Coroners in Ontario are medical doctors with specialized 
training in death investigation
* Available to the community 24 hrs a day/7 days a week
* Coroners report to the Chief Coroner who is responsible 
for all coroners in Ontario
* Coroners investigate deaths that happen under certain 
circumstances as determined by a provincial law called the 
Coroners Act of Ontario
Currently have dual leadership
  * Office of the Chief Coroner & Ontario Forensic Pathology Service
